# Jessica's meta-wishlist

A list of things Jessica would like (for Christmas, birthdays, etc.), made because I keep having trouble coming up with an answer to the question of what Iâ€™d like!

## How

Jekyll and GitHub Pages, reading from a YAML file.

`_data/wishlist.yml` is where all the info lives.
