Technology Notes
----------------

This is the boilerplate I use for all of my web explorations. [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) provides the same React concepts and API in a much smaller package. It's a fast way of making fast websites.

If you'd like to use any React libraries from npm, you can easily mix them in with preact. All you have to do  is also add [preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat).

This template doesn't have any sort of CSS pipeline, the CSS is defined raw in the front-end at `public/index.css`.
