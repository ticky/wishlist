# Jessica’s meta-wishlist
A list of things Jessica would like (for Christmas, birthdays, etc.), made because I keep having trouble coming up with an answer to the question of what I’d like!

## Other Lists
<ul>
  {{wishlists.map((wishlist) => <ExternalWishlist list={wishlist} />)}}
</ul>

## Things
Anything which doesn’t go on a list elsewhere can live here.
<ul>
  {{things.map((thing) => <Thing thing={thing} />)}}
</ul>
