    notes: |
      This cradle can be pretty expensive. It seems like they didn't make a lot of them!
      Solaris seem the least likely to gouge, but shopping around is a good idea.

      These seem to be out of production and the prices are skyrocketing, particularly for  
      the English-package versions, but Callie and Marie (also known as Aori & Hotaru,  
      Ayo & Oly, Mar & Tina, and several other names in various global releases) are wonderful.

      A mod project for the slim PS2 I'd like to attempt someday. Cables to allow connecting a hard drive to the slim PS2.

      Really cool! A vacuum-fluorescent display salvaged from a Soviet cassette deck, built into a neat little project kit.

      Not to be confused with the PSP go version, this one is a bit more attainable.
      Again, I think Solaris will be the best bet for reasonable pricing.
      There are at least two models, but I believe they're both equivalent in features and included parts.
      I'm particularly intrigued by the inclusion of a remote control!
