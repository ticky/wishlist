      A very cute little soldering kit I'd love to have a go at, and a pretty little accessory to keep somewhere once it's finished! Sadly only ships to Australia and New Zealand.

    notes: |
      This is a tiny computer which is similar to the Raspberry Pi Zero, which you are more likely to have heard of.
      It includes a few extra features which are intriguing for some projects I've been considering putting together.
      Unfortunately, as a bit of a niche Chinese product, it's more or less only available from distributors in China proper, which can make shipping a pain.

    notes: |
      This got expensive fast, but this Japanese-exclusive limited release (which includes  
      English menus & voices) is the only way to get a physical copy of these games on Switch.  
      The bonus stuff it comes with is really cool, too! Probably a bit of a stretch, though.
