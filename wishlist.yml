      This is a tiny computer which is similar to the Raspberry Pi Zero, which you are more likely to have heard of.
      It includes a few extra features which are intriguing for some projects I've been considering putting together.
      Unfortunately, as a bit of a niche Chinese product, it's more or less only available from distributors in China proper, which can make shipping a pain.

    notes: |
      A linear DC power supply would be real useful for me with my electronics projects. 30V is overkill but it at least gives plenty of wiggle room.
      This model seems to be pretty decent from reviews I've looked at, and as a bonus it's programmable over USB!

      A flash cartridge for the original GameBoy consoles.
      This will allow me to experiment with games I didn't get to play much, and to fiddle with homebrew software.
      Please make sure if you find it that you avoid getting the Revision A, as this has issues with the GameBoy Pocket!

      This got expensive fast, but this Japanese-exclusive limited release (which includes  
      English menus & voices) is the only way to get a physical copy of these games on Switch.  
      The bonus stuff it comes with is really cool, too! Probably a bit of a stretch, though.

      A *very* pretty GameBoy model from 1997, including a built-in backlight and in a gorgeous translucent yellow case.
      If I won a lottery, this is the GameBoy I'd probably treat myself to. They seem to go for somewhere between $200 and $800.
      Note that lots of them (including expensive ones!) are either missing or have different coloured battery doors fitted, and this is a real shame.
      Two of the ones I linked are also missing their model and/or serial number stickers, which is less bad but still a little nasty.

      A mod project for the slim PS2 I'd like to attempt someday. Cables to allow connecting a hard drive to the slim PS2.

      Really cool! A vacuum-fluorescent display salvaged from a Soviet cassette deck, built into a neat little project kit.
