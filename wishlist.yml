      This is a tiny, single-board computer which is similar to the Raspberry Pi Zero you may have heard of,
      but includes a few extra features which are intriguing for some projects I've been considering putting together.
      Unfortunately, as a bit of a niche Chinese product, it's more or less only available from distributors in China proper.

      This got expensive fast, but this Japanese-exclusive limited release (which includes  
      English menus & voices) is the only way to get a physical copy of these games on Switch.  
      The bonus stuff it comes with is really cool, too! Probably a bit of a stretch, though.

      A mod project for the slim PS2 I'd like to attempt someday. Cables to allow connecting a hard drive to the slim PS2.

      Really cool! A vacuum-fluorescent display salvaged from a Soviet cassette deck, built into a neat little project kit.
