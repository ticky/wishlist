    notes: |
      A gorgeous little digital watch from 1999 which features one of my favourite quirky features, Internet Time!
      This watch has a dedicated portion of its face for the decimal time readout, and the milky white with a dash of colour looks great.
      Might be hard to track down in good condition, but there seems to regularly be a handful on eBay
      (I'd prefer one without the watch body too yellowed compared to the strap, if possible!)

      Quite an intriguing looking little wireless controller adapter for the PS1 and PS2, which allows the use of modern Bluetooth controllers with these consoles.
      Not in stock at the time of writing, but someday…

    notes: |
      This is a tiny computer which is similar to the Raspberry Pi Zero, which you are more likely to have heard of.
      It includes a few extra features which are intriguing for some projects I've been considering putting together.
      Unfortunately, as a bit of a niche Chinese product, it's more or less only available from distributors in China proper, which can make shipping a pain.
