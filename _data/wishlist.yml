  - name: "MemCard PRO2"
    link: "https://8bitmods.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2-and-ps1-smoke-black/"
    notes: |
      A modern, high-capacity and very flexible and convenient memory card for the venerable PlayStation and PlayStation 2.
      My current solution to space issues is to copy saves to my PS2's hard drive, but this is fragile and easy to mess up.

  - name: PS1 & PS2 UnoRetro Adapter
    link: "https://www.willsconsolemodifications.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&path=59_67&product_id=52"
    notes: |
      Quite an intriguing looking little wireless controller adapter for the PS1 and PS2, which allows the use of modern Bluetooth controllers with these consoles.
      Not in stock at the time of writing, but someday…

    notes: |
      A gorgeous little digital watch from 1999 which features one of my favourite quirky features, Internet Time!
      This watch has a dedicated portion of its face for the decimal time readout, and the milky white with a dash of colour looks great.
      Might be hard to track down in good condition, but there seems to regularly be a handful on eBay
      (I'd prefer one without the watch body too yellowed compared to the strap, if possible!)

    notes: |
      A clever hard drive enclosure which can emulate a CD drive. Would be handy for working with computers in general, and particularly older ones.

    notes: |
      A compact cassette deck which would integrate with my hi-fi system.
      As a bonus, it's a highly capable model from the turn of the century, and so capable of playing almost any cassette I might want.
