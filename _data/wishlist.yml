  - name: Swatch .beat “Site”, in white (model SQW100)
    link: "https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Swatch+SQW100&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&rt=nc&LH_PrefLoc=2"
    notes: |
      A gorgeous little digital watch from 1999 which features one of my favourite quirky features, Internet Time!
      This watch has a dedicated portion of its face for the decimal time readout, and the milky white with a dash of colour looks great.
      Might be hard to track down in good condition, but there seems to regularly be a handful on eBay
      (I'd prefer one without the watch body too yellowed compared to the strap, if possible!)

  - name: Tangara portable music player
    link: "https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara"
    notes: |
      This is a neat little hardware project by a friend of a friend that I would love to support once preorders become available.

    notes: |
      These convert a Wii Guitar Hero guitar like I have into a wired universal guitar controller.
      There are a few models available but they're all broadly similar.

    notes: |

      The "2" is a newer version with broader support and more customisation options.

    notes: |
      These are my favourite whisky glasses, and I used to have a set but I lost them in the move.
      I'd love to have some again. So far I've only found them in foodservice quantities but I got lucky once so maybe there's a way…

      - "https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_nkw=Onkyo+505FX"
    notes: |
      A compact cassette deck which would integrate with my hi-fi system.
      As a bonus, it's a highly capable model from the turn of the century, and so capable of playing almost any cassette I might want.

  - name: "MemCard PRO2"
    link: "https://8bitmods.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2-and-ps1-smoke-black/"
    notes: |
      A modern, high-capacity and very flexible and convenient memory card for the venerable PlayStation and PlayStation 2.
      My current solution to space issues is to copy saves to my PS2's hard drive, but this is fragile and easy to mess up.

  - name: PS1 & PS2 UnoRetro Adapter
    link: "https://www.willsconsolemodifications.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&path=59_67&product_id=52"
    notes: |
      Quite an intriguing looking little wireless controller adapter for the PS1 and PS2, which allows the use of modern Bluetooth controllers with these consoles.
      Not in stock at the time of writing, but someday…

  - name: Cat Soldering Kit
    link: "https://www.adafruit.com/product/5237"
    notes: |
      A very cute little soldering kit I'd love to have a go at, and a pretty little accessory to keep somewhere once it's finished!

    link: "https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/straps/products/cuff?variant=9783844110380"

    notes: |
      Handbrake which goes with the racing wheel setup I've begun to assemble. This would make the whole thing more realistic.

    notes: |
      A USB hub on a tiny circuit board. I've got some ideas for projects incorporating these!

    link: "http://www.maxdiypower.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=80"
    notes: |
      A mod project for the slim PS2 I'd like to attempt someday. Cables to allow connecting a hard drive to the slim PS2.
